   abstract = {Selecting progenies evaluated in different seasons, locations, and years is a challenge for breeders in plant breeding programs. This is because different environmental conditions can lead to differential expression of genes involved in controlling traits of interest, resulting in the genotype × environment (G × E) interaction. Utilizing the G × E interaction appropriately can enhance the selection of multiple traits when progenies are evaluated in different environments. Probabilistic Bayesian models have shown the ability to consider the effects of the G × E interaction to calculate the risk of recommending a given candidate genotype for selection. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to propose a selection index based on probabilistic Bayesian models and to apply it to a selection of bean families. To this end, 380 common bean families from the third recurrent selection cycle of the carioca common bean breeding program at the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) were evaluated over four environments for the following traits: grain yield (GY), commercial grain appearance (CGA), and plant architecture (PA). Based on the proposed Bayesian probabilistic selection index (BPSI), which ranks the multitrait superior performance of families across environments, and a selection intensity of 10%, 12 superior families were identified. These families had a higher probability of superior performance in all environments for the traits GY (28%), CGA (52%), and PA (62%) simultaneously compared to the check cultivars. Compared to other indices, the BPSI selects families with lower sum ranks, for example, top positions have a probability of superior performance across environments, and with at least 42% of families that do not match other indices. The BPSI selection index showed promise for selecting families in a common bean breeding program.},

   abstract = {Key message: We propose using probability concepts from Bayesian models to leverage a more informed decision-making process toward cultivar recommendation in multi-environment trials. Abstract: Statistical models that capture the phenotypic plasticity of a genotype across environments are crucial in plant breeding programs to potentially identify parents, generate offspring, and obtain highly productive genotypes for target environments. In this study, our aim is to leverage concepts of Bayesian models and probability methods of stability analysis to untangle genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI). The proposed method employs the posterior distribution obtained with the No-U-Turn sampler algorithm to get Hamiltonian Monte Carlo estimates of adaptation and stability probabilities. We applied the proposed models in two empirical tropical datasets. Our findings provide a basis to enhance our ability to consider the uncertainty of cultivar recommendation for global or specific adaptation. We further demonstrate that probability methods of stability analysis in a Bayesian framework are a powerful tool for unraveling GEI given a defined intensity of selection that results in a more informed decision-making process toward cultivar recommendation in multi-environment trials.},

   abstract = {Neglecting genotype-by-environment interactions in multienvironment trials (MET) increases the risk of flawed cultivar recommendations for growers. Recent advancements in probability theory coupled with cutting-edge software offer a more streamlined decision-making process for selecting suitable candidates across diverse environments. Here, we present the user-friendly ProbBreed package in R, which allows breeders to calculate the probability of a given genotype outperforming competitors under a Bayesian framework. This article outlines the package's basic workflow and highlights its key features, ranging from MET model fitting to estimating the per se and pairwise probabilities of superior performance and stability for selection candidates. Remarkably, only the selection intensity is required to compute these probabilities. By democratizing this complex yet efficient methodology, ProbBreed aims to enhance decision-making and ultimately contribute to more accurate cultivar recommendations in breeding programs.},

   abstract = {The growing global demand for soybean protein is driving the expansion of cultivation into new agricultural frontiers. Kenya has been progressing in the development of soybean genotypes to identify those best adapted to its diverse agroecological conditions. However, the selection of genotypes with superior agronomic traits and high stability remains limited. This study quantified the magnitude of genotype-by-environment (G $$\times$$ E) interaction and selected genotypes with the best performance and stability based on a multi-trait approach. A total of 65 genotypes were evaluated across 19 environments from 2019 to 2023/24 growing seasons using a randomized complete block design. Stability was assessed using the Weighted Average of Absolute Scores index, considering plant height (PH), number of days to maturity (NDM), and grain yield (GY). Multi-trait selection was performed using the Desired Gain Index, applying a 20% selection intensity, followed by the genetic gain estimation. Using the likelihood ratio test, we identified significant effects of genotype, environment, and G $$\times$$ E interaction. The overall mean values observed in the experiments were 62.30 cm for PH, 120 days for NDM, and 1783.70 kg ha−1 for GY. In the multi-trait analysis, we selected the ideotypes G42, G26, G46, G35, G53, G41, G12, G54, G39, G52, G02, and G37. This selection resulted in a genetic gain of 6.5% for PH, 1.3% for NDM, and 15.6% for GY. These genotypes exhibited high genetic potential and adaptation to Kenyan conditions.},
